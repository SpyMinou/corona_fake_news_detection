                    Our project aimed to fight against fake news specifically related to COVID-19 by developing a detection system. using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, we trained a model that can analyze various sources of information and identify COVID-19 misinformation accurately. With this project, our primary objective was to contribute to the global efforts in combating COVID-19 misinformation by providing a tool that helps individuals to distinguish between real and fake news online.
